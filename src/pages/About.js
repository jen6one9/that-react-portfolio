      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p> I'm Jeneth, an IT project manager for a global financial institution with experience
                        in managing offshore/onshore teams for multi-million dollar technology projects. My journey in
                        tech began as a systems analyst associate, testing for both mainframe systems and online banking
                        applications. I'm a Certified Scrum Master and looking to expand my skillset by
                        becoming an IT Tech Lead within my dynamic team. I am firm believer in the power of
                        collaboration, grit and teamwork to successfully execute projects. I also believe in the
                        importance of peer recognition as an important building block in creating an excellent company culture. 
                        Above all else, I've developed a customer first mindset.  I believe in earning and keeping the customer's trust. This means paying close attention
                        to the details and ensuring the user has an excellent experience. 
                        
                     <p>Beyond the normal work day, I'm actively involved in NextGen Leaders, an employee resource group
                        (ERG) which seeks to bring together diverse individuals across the generations to network,
                        collaborate, and make meaningful connections.</p>
